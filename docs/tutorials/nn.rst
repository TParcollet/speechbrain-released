This tutorial describes how to combine (use and finetune) pretrained models
coming from HuggingFace. Any wav2vec 2.0 / HuBERT / WavLM or Whisper model integrated to the transformers interface of HuggingFace can be then plugged to
SpeechBrain to approach a speech-related task: automatic speech recognition, speaker recognition,
spoken language understanding ...

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the SpeechBrain implementation of complex-valued and quaternion-valued neural networks
for speech technologies. It covers the basics of highdimensional representations and the associated neural layers :
Linear, Convolution, Recurrent and Normalisation.

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) offer a natural way to process sequences.
This tutorial demonstrates how to use the SpeechBrain implementations of RNNs including LSTMs, GRU, RNN and LiGRU a specific recurrent cell designed
for speech-related tasks. RNNs are at the core of many sequence to sequence models.
